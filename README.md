## However if you want to deliver the course, go right ahead. 

LaunchPad is a curriculum to help Smart Students to become Smart Engineers. It could be also be useful for experienced developers as a refresher. The course focuses on various software engineering practices and is delivered using a [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method "Wikipedia"). More about the Socratic Method of delivery later. 

### Smart Students

Students that are recently graduated in Computer Science have good exposure to algorithms, writing snippets of code for performing an action but could use a primer on writing real world maintainable complex software in quick iterations with best practices and right approach to: version control, continuous integration, agile development, right tools, design patterns etc.
