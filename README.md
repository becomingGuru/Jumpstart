LaunchPad is a finishing school for programmers which helps good programmers to become exceptional. It helps them enhance their Software Engineering skills to solve the problems in the demanding and ever-changing industry. It is delivered through continuous interactions using the [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method "Wikipedia").

### Target Audience

Students that are recently graduated in Computer Science have good exposure to algorithms, writing snippets of code for performing an action but could use a primer on writing real world maintainable complex software in quick iterations with best practices and right approach to: version control, continuous integration, agile development, right tools, design patterns etc.

### Smart Engineer

Certain practices and principles help a programmer to be a smart engineer. The most significant traits of a good programmer is an ability to think about the problem domain at various abstraction levels.

* Agility
* Design
* Continuous Learning
* Tech Agnostic
